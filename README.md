The code here accompanies the thesis submitted for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy entitled "Statistical and machine learning methods to estimate the impact of antimicrobial resistance on patient outcomes". The code has deliberately been rendered as R markdowns to maximise accessibility even for the non-R-initiated!
